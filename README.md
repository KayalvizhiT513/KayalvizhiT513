# Hi, I’m Kayalvizhi 👋

I’m **Kayalvizhi T**, an **Agentic AI & Machine Learning Engineer** building intelligent, autonomous systems and full-stack applications.

I work across **AI reasoning, data science, and scalable engineering**, using tools like **LangChain, FastAPI, React, Snowflake, and AWS** to turn ideas into production-ready systems.

🧠 **Deep Learning Focus**
I’m studying deep learning **beyond black-box usage**—deriving equations, understanding optimization dynamics, and validating assumptions mathematically to build models that are **robust, interpretable, and well-grounded**.
